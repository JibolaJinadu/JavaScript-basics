# JavaScript-basics

1.	What runs JavaScript outside the browser? 
    Node

2.	Name 5 things JavaScript can do.
    i.	Mobile Apps: You can use JavaScript to create mobile applications. One of the more popular frameworks for doing so is React Native, which helps programmers build native apps using JavaScript.
    ii.	Frontend web development: JavaScript is useful for front-end development because it allows programmers to add dynamic, interactive elements to web pages. You can use JavaScript code to create custom form validation, show and hide elements depending on user actions or events, animate websites, and more in your web pages.
    iii.	Backend web development: JavaScript can also be used for web development on the server. This allows JavaScript developers to use their skills to work with both front-end and back-end aspects of a website.
    iv.	Desktop applications: JavaScript is also used for creating desktop applications thanks to platforms like Electron and NW.js. Electron is backed by GitHub and is a compelling framework that you can use to build cross-platform desktop applications.
    v.	Game development: JavaScript has also worked its way into the gaming industry. With HTML5, developers can create small games or game elements inside an existing webpage (for example, a banner ad or a moving object on the side of a webpage).

3.	When was ECMAScript first released?
    1997

4.	How do you log to the console?
    console.log(message);

5.	List the tech fields that use JavaScript, for example FrontEnd.
    a.	UX Designer.
    b.	DevOps Engineer.
    c.	Full-stack Developer.
    d.	Backend Developer.
    e.	UI Designer.
    f.	Web Designer
    g.	Web Applications Developer.
    h.	JavaScript Developer.

6.	Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category?
    First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically-typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like JavaScript) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

    Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.

    Statically-typed programming languages means when we declare a variable, the type of that variable cannot be changed in the future, for example;
    String name = ‘David’;

    Dynamically-typed programming languages means when we declare a variable, the type of the variable can be changed at run-time, changing from value type string to number, for example;
    Let name = ‘David’;
    Let name = 77;

7.	Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined?
    A primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.” The keyword here is intentional. Whereas undefined can be unintentionally assigned if we forget to define a variable.

    Null means an empty or non-existence value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing. For example;
    let test1 = null;
    console.log(test1);

    Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined. For example;
    Let test2;
    console.log(test2);
